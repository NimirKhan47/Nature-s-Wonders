        <p class="content">Water bodies are crucial for Earth's ecosystems. Oceans, covering 71% of the planet, regulate climate and support marine life. Rivers and streams provide freshwater, habitats, and transportation routes, with major rivers like the Amazon and Nile being vital. Lakes and ponds store freshwater and support local ecosystems. Wetlands filter pollutants, control floods, and provide habitats. Groundwater, stored in aquifers, is essential for drinking water and irrigation. Protecting these water bodies is vital for maintaining biodiversity, ensuring clean water, and supporting life. Conservation efforts and sustainable practices are necessary to preserve these precious resources for future generations.</p>
